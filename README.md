# owoScript

owoScript is a stack based, imperative, and Turing complete programming language. 
owoScript works with a simple and descriptive language 
that is then compiled to the best bytecode to ever exist on this planet.

Why is owoScript bytecode the best on the planet? Because it's entirely made out of 
OwO faces! Why have the speed and portability of the JVM when you can have the most *adorable* 
code out of almost any language you can write in? And never fear, your owoScript bytecode can easily be turned
back into the higher level form at any time.

Additionally, owoScript leaves its syntax and parsing files easily accessible to be inspected and verified by 
anyone. owoScript's grammar is written in ANTLR4, a parsing tool so out of this world reliable and efficient that 
you'll wonder why your favorite programming language isn't using it yet.

### Examples
See the `/examples` directory for a hello world, truth machine, and a proof of turing completeness via 
brainfuck equivalents (does your fancy OOP language prove that it is capable of universal computation? 
Can you trust it if it doesn't?)

### Usage
Coming soon

### Why
I'm sure the question everyone is thinking is "why." Why make a programming language entirely in OwO faces? 
Why go out of my way to implement a formal grammar with a parser for a meme? 

The simple answer, of course, is because 
I hate myself. The more accurate answer is because I wanted to try out writing a basic interpreter and grammar in
ANTLR, in preparation for possibly writing an LLVM compiler for a few esoteric programming languages in the near future

### Credits
I dedicate this project to all of my friends who answer the phone with "hewwo" so often I want to bash my head in.
